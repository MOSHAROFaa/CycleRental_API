# CycleRental_API
Here I used Java Spring Boot and MySQL to develop REST API (CRUD) for Cycle Rental System. The API can be checked through Postman and perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
To use this API you can change the application.properties where MySQL is connected. You need to add your MySQL username and password as well as provide the port number.
